# shortcut2vid
ffmpeg wrapper to take images via shortcuts, and create an mp4 video. 

# Workflow:
Create a folder, name it something memorable (project/character/whatever)
Select all the images (from img2img or from anywhere really) that are going to be a part of this video.
Right click + drag into the newly created empty folder. A context menu will pop up; select "Create Shortcuts Here" option.
